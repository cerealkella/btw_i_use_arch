Helper menu-driven CLI for installing packages and setting up Linux components on an 
Arch-based system.
If performing a clean install - ALWAYS RUN PACMAN SYSTEM UPDATES FIRST!
Disclaimer: As of the initial deployment of this package,
I have never actually tried to build myself an Arch system, so please don't
tell me I'm a no-nothing n00b. In many respects I am, but don't tell me. :)
Manjaro suits my needs quite nicely, and I like it with KDE.
